# script to extract dimensions 61-120 of the dna dataset
# According to https://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/DNA.names,
# " Hint.   Much better performance is generally observed if attributes
#           closest to the junction are used. In the StatLog version, 
#           this means using attributes A61 to A120 only."
